### Welcome back! Lets dive into React-Redux Toolkit! For those of you who are just learning to use Redux, Redux is designed to enable the use of a global state. The use of global state makes state flow much easier. Instead of passing state through props and "prop tunneling" (which is mainly passing state down through components that wont even be using the state in order to reach it's desired component) we now have a way to access state directly. This creates easily understood code, prevents errors and bugs, and allows our apps to preform better.

> Redux Toolkit is an excellent package for an easier, cleaner, faster way to learn about Redux without all of the verbose boilerplate configuration code. Lets keep it simple and go over Redux toolkit, specfically designed to include everything we need in our Redux project.

I have made this tutorial in a codesandbox which I will link at the end for you to see the final project.
Lets begin by opening a new React-App in your favorite IDE or codesandbox.<br>
open your commandline<br>
cd into your project's root folder<br>
then type in the commandline<br>
`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`
