### Hey everyone, this is my first blog post after completing this gastsby blog project. It was a really fun challenge learning how to use Gatsby Js and Graphql to make this.

> I always wanted to start a blog based around everything I'm learning currently. Im not sure what direction I will take this in the future but for now I'm going to keep it centered around React and Javascript topics, especially for people who are just starting their React and/or Javascript journey.

There are plenty of blog posts, articles and tutorials alike on the web based on helping others understand some aspect of web development a little bit better than the last but I am hoping that by using my ability to simplify complex concepts I will be able to help others struggle just a little less than I had to.

I will try to post once or twice a week here so feel free to pop back in and check out the blog anytime.

~Happy Coding!
